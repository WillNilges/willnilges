### Hi, I'm Willard (he/him) 🦎 🏳️‍🌈 🐧 👾

I'm a 5th Year Computer Engineering Major at RIT, Linux Fanatic, OpenShift Goblin™, and Shiny Object Enthusiast.

I work on all kinds of stuff. More often than not it's probably some backend/devops nonsense for @ComputerScienceHouse. My friends in Rochester are deploying shiny new hardware to play with 🔥 So I'm putting some time into improving the software that runs on that hardware (Or, well, trying to, if only I'd stop getting distracted by shiny objects 🙃)

Check out these projects, and/or the ones I have pinned: 

- https://github.com/computersciencehouse/proxstar
- https://github.com/willnilges/letmein2
- https://github.com/willnilges/inkpath

Currently Co-Op'ing at Datadog working on their Metrics Resolution team maintaining services in Python and Go.
