### Hi, I'm Willard 🦎 🏳️‍🌈 🐧 👾

<p align="center">
<strong>Computer Engineer, Linux Fanatic, OpenShift Goblin™, and Shiny Object Enthusiast.</strong>
</p>

I work on all kinds of stuff. Mosly devops, VR Hacking, graphics programming, and the occasional tool or script for a wide variety of _extremely_ unrelated projects.

I'd pick just one thing to focus on, but that'd require not getting distracted by shiny objects 🙃
