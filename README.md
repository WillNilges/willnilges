### Hi, I'm Willard (he/him) 🦎 🏳️‍🌈 🐧 👾

I'm a 4th Year Computer Engineering Major at RIT, Linux Fanatic, OpenShift Goblin™, and Shiny Object Enthusiast.

I work on all kinds of stuff. More often than not it's probably some backend/devops nonsense for @ComputerScienceHouse, the student org that ~~owns my soul~~ I'm a part of.

I just finished directing CSH's ImagineRIT project, CSHacked! We built a cool asset-tracking mesh network and gave people access to it the during ImagineRIT 2022 so they could find some "hackers" that roaming campus. It was a smashing success! I'm so proud of everyone who worked on it, they did a great job!

This summer, I'll be Co-Op'ing at Datadog working on their Metrics Resolution team. Super excited for that!
