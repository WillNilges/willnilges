### Hi, I'm Willard (he/him) 🦎 🏳️‍🌈 🐧 👾

I'm a 5th Year Computer Engineering Major at RIT, Linux Fanatic, OpenShift Goblin™, and Shiny Object Enthusiast.

I work on all kinds of stuff. More often than not it's probably some backend/devops nonsense for @ComputerScienceHouse. This summer, I'm working on setting up and migrating all of our stuff over to new hardware. Right now, I'm in the middle of migrating OpenShift, Proxmox, and Ceph infra.

I have a handful of projects that I'm _trying_ to work on, if only I'd stop getting distracted by shiny objects 🙃

Currently Co-Op'ing at Datadog working on their Metrics Resolution team maintaining services in Python and Go (and learning a helluva lot about distributed systems and cloud infra while I'm at it).

Here are some links. Happy Pride! 🏳️‍⚧️ 🏳️‍🌈 ❤️
