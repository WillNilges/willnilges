### Hi, I'm Willard (he/him) 🦎 🏳️‍🌈 🐧 👾

<h5 align="center">
5th Year Computer Engineering Major at RIT, Linux Fanatic, OpenShift Goblin™, and Shiny Object Enthusiast.

I work on all kinds of stuff. More often than not it's probably some backend/devops nonsense for @ComputerScienceHouse. My friends in Rochester are deploying shiny new hardware to play with 🔥 So I'm putting some time into improving the software that runs on that hardware, like [proxstar](https://github.com/computersciencehouse/proxstar)

Or, well, trying to, if only I'd stop getting distracted by shiny objects 🙃

Currently Co-Op'ing at Datadog working on their Metrics Resolution team maintaining services in Python and Go.
