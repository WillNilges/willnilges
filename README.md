### Hi, I'm Willard (he/they) 🦎 🏳️‍🌈 🐧 👾

<p align="center">
<strong>5th Year Computer Engineering Major at RIT, Linux Fanatic, OpenShift Goblin™, and Shiny Object Enthusiast.</strong>
</p>

I work on all kinds of stuff. Lately, it has been a mix of GPU code, inventory management tools, socket programming, embedded VR controllers, and other backend/devops/embedded nonsense. 

I'd pick just one thing to focus on, but that'd require not getting distracted by shiny objects 🙃
