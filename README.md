### Hi, I'm  🦎 🏳️‍🌈 Willard (he/him) 🐧 👾

I'm a 4th Year Computer Engineering Major at RIT, Linux Fanatic, OpenShift Goblin™, and Shiny Object Enthusiast.

I work on all kinds of stuff. More often than not it's probably some backend/devops nonsense for @ComputerScienceHouse, the student org that ~~owns my soul~~ I'm a part of.

Currently, I'm directing CSH's ImagineRIT project, CSHacked! We're building a cool asset-tracking mesh network and we're going to give people access to it the day of imagine and challenge them to find some "hackers" that are roaming campus.

This summer, I'll be Co-Op'ing at Datadog working on their Metrics Resolution team. Super excited for that!
