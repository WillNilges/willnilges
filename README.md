### Hi, I'm Willard 🦎 🏳️‍🌈 🐧 👾

<strong>Computer Engineer, Linux Fanatic, DevOps Goblin™.</strong>

I'm interested in a pretty wide variety of computing topics, and I work on all kinds of stuff. Right now, it's a lot of software tools, monitoring, and other services for [NYC Mesh](https://nycmesh.net). I'm also a backend programmer at [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com). Currently living in NYC, always down to meet new folks!
